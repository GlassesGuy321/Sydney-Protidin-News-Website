# Sydney Protidin

This is the repo that hosts the news blog সিডনি প্রতিদিন (Sydney Protidin) - a freelance news reporting site. This is a realtime website being used, accompanied by the facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/sydneyprotidin).

This project is a fullstack web application that used MERN:

 - **M**ongoDB - creating and storing users and posts within a non-SQL database
 - **E**xpress.js - web application framework powering the backend server
 - **R**eact - Javascript User Interface Library powering the frontend as a single-page website.
 - **N**odeJS - allowing the backend to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development.
